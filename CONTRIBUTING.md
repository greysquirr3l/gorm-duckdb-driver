## Roadmap to Official GORM Integration

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ Core implementation complete
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite
- ‚úÖ Documentation and examples
- üîÑ Community testing and feedback
- ‚è≥ Performance optimization
- ‚è≥ Additional features based on community needs

4. **Improve documentation** and examples
5. **Performance testing** and optimization
6. **Community feedback** and adoption

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components

- `dialector.go`: Main GORM dialector implementation
- `migrator.go`: Schema migration and introspection
- Connection wrapper for DuckDB-specific handling
- Auto-increment via DuckDB sequences

### Design Decisions

- Uses `information_schema` for introspection (no schema filtering needed)
- Implements connection wrapper for `*time.Time` ‚Üí `time.Time` conversion
- Follows GORM patterns established by MySQL/PostgreSQL drivers
- Comprehensive error handling and translation
