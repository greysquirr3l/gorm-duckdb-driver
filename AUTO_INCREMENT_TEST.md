# Auto-Increment Functionality Test Results

## Summary

This document verifies that the GORM DuckDB driver correctly handles auto-increment primary keys using DuckDB's sequence-based approach with RETURNING clauses.

## Test Results

### ✅ Primary Key Auto-Increment Working

- **Status**: PASSED
- **Implementation**: Custom GORM callback using RETURNING clause
- **DuckDB Sequence**: Automatically created during migration

### ✅ CRUD Operations Working

- **Create**: Auto-increment ID correctly set in Go struct
- **Read**: Records found by auto-generated ID
- **Update**: Updates work with auto-generated IDs
- **Delete**: Deletions work with auto-generated IDs

### ✅ Data Type Handling

- **Integer Types**: uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int, int8, int16, int32, int64
- **Auto-detection**: Correctly identifies auto-increment fields
- **Type Safety**: Proper type conversion for ID field assignment

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **duckdb.go** (renamed from dialector.go)
   - Added custom `createCallback` function
   - Added `buildInsertSQL` function  
   - Integrated RETURNING clause support
   - Type-safe ID field assignment

2. **migrator.go**
   - Enhanced `CreateTable` to create sequences for auto-increment fields
   - Pattern: `CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS seq_{table}_{field} START 1`

3. **error_translator.go**
   - New file for DuckDB-specific error handling
   - Following GORM adapter patterns

### Key Features

- **RETURNING Clause**: `INSERT ... RETURNING id` for auto-generated IDs
- **Sequence Management**: Automatic sequence creation during migration
- **Type Safety**: Handles both signed and unsigned integer types
- **Fallback Support**: Default GORM behavior for non-auto-increment cases

## Test Command

```bash
go test -v
```

## All Tests Passing ✅

## Verification Complete ✅

The GORM DuckDB driver now follows standard GORM adapter patterns and correctly handles auto-increment primary keys using DuckDB's native sequence and RETURNING capabilities.
